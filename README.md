* [DataWraith/auto_mkdir](https://github.com/DataWraith/auto_mkdir) - Allows you to save files into directories that do not exist yet
* [chazy/cscope_maps](https://github.com/chazy/cscope_maps) - Cscope keyboard mappings

`map <leader>w   ^Ww`                                                 | Move between screens. Note that the other mappings (<C-j>, <C-k>, etc.) are still available.
`map <leader>=   ^W=`                                                 |
`map <leader>j   ^Wj`                                                 |
`map <leader>k   ^Wk`                                                 |
`map <leader>rv  :source ~/.vimrc<CR>`                                | Reload .vimrc
`map <silent> <F7> gg=G`` :delmarks z<CR>:echo "Reformatted."<CR>`    | Auto-indent whole file. Note that <leader>= is still available.

Note that <leader>t (run a focused test) and <leader>T (run the test file) are still available, but use the "testify" plugin, which will run the tests using vim-dispatch and put the results in the quickfix window for easy navigation. <cr><cr> is also an alias for <leader>T. Since the "testify" plugin keeps track of the last test that was ran, the "RunTestAgain" and "RunTestPrevious" are no longer needed.
